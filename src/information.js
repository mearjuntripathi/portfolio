    about_text: `<p>
            I am Arjun Tripathi, a passionate and skilled Software Engineer with a strong academic background and
            diverse technical expertise. I hold a Master's degree in Computer Application from Dr. A. P. J. Abdul Kalam
            Technical University and a Bachelor's degree in Computer Application from Mahatma Gandhi Kashi Vidyapith
            University. My professional journey includes an internship at Rhizicube, where I developed production-ready
            APIs using <b>GO</b>, <b>NodeJS</b>, <b>REST API</b>, and <b>gRPC</b>. I am proficient in various
            programming languages and
            frameworks, including <b>C</b>, <b>C++</b>, <b>JAVA</b>, <b>PHP</b>, <b>HTML/CSS</b>, <b>JavaScript</b>,
            <b>ReactJS</b>, and <b>ExpressJS</b>.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have demonstrated my technical capabilities through several significant projects, such as developing a
            company portfolio website and an online test portal. I have also created a real-time <b>Tic Tac Toe game</b>
            and a
            <b>REST API</b> using <b>Go Lang</b> and <b>Docker</b>. My problem-solving skills are evident from my
            achievements on competitive
            coding platforms like <b>CodeChef</b>, <b>LeetCode</b>, and <b>HackerRank</b>. With my strong technical
            foundation and hands-on
            experience, I am well-equipped to tackle complex software engineering challenges.
